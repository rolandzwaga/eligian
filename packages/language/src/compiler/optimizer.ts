/**
 * Optimizer: IR â†’ Optimized IR
 *
 * This module performs optimization passes on the Eligius IR to:
 * - Remove unreachable/dead code (events that will never trigger)
 * - Fold constants at compile time
 * - Merge adjacent/overlapping events where possible
 *
 * Design principles (Constitution VI):
 * - External API is immutable (Effect types, readonly IR)
 * - Internal mutation allowed for performance (building optimized arrays)
 * - Document all internal mutations with comments
 * - Optimizations never fail (returns Effect<EligiusIR, never>)

 * - Merging adjacent timeline actions with the same operations
 * - Deduplicating identical operations
