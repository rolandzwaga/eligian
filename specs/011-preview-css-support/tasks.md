**Feature**: 011-preview-css-support
**Branch**: `011-preview-css-support`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for CSS loading feature

- [x] T001 Create directory structure for CSS loading components in `packages/extension/src/extension/`
- [x] T002 [P] Create test directory `packages/extension/__tests__/` for CSS loading tests
- [x] T003 [P] Update `packages/extension/tsconfig.json` to include new CSS loading modules

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core utilities that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 [P] [Foundation] Implement `generateCSSId()` function in `packages/extension/src/extension/css-loader.ts` - Generate stable unique identifier from file path using SHA-256 hash
- [x] T005 [P] [Foundation] Implement `convertToWebviewUri()` function in `packages/extension/src/extension/css-loader.ts` - Convert file system paths to webview URIs using `webview.asWebviewUri()`

- [x] T008 [P] [Foundation] Implement `extractCSSFiles()` function in `packages/extension/src/extension/css-loader.ts` - Extract CSS file paths from compiled Eligius configuration

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Foundation ready - CSS loading utilities available for all user stories

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Apply Imported CSS in Preview (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: When a developer imports a CSS file in their Eligian file, the preview webview automatically loads and applies that CSS to the rendered timeline.

**Independent Test**: Import a CSS file in an Eligian file, open the preview, and verify that the styles are applied to the preview content.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T009 [P] [US1] Create `WebviewCSSInjector` class in `packages/extension/src/extension/webview-css-injector.ts` - Initialize with webview and workspace root
- [x] T010 [US1] Implement `injectCSS()` method in `webview-css-injector.ts` - Initial CSS load when preview opens (loads all CSS files, rewrites URLs, sends messages in order)
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Add webview message handler script to preview HTML template - Handle `css-load` messages and inject `<style>` tags using `textContent`
- [x] T012 [US1] Integrate CSS injection into preview manager in `packages/extension/src/extension/preview-manager.ts` - Extract CSS files from compiled config, create injector, call `injectCSS()`
- [x] T013 [US1] Configure Content Security Policy in preview HTML - Add `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`, `img-src`, `font-src` directives (already configured)
- [x] T014 [US1] Update preview manager to pass CSS files to webview - Extract from compiled Eligius config using `extractCSSFiles()`

**Checkpoint**: CSS files load into preview when opening an Eligian file with `styles` imports ‚úÖ

**Implementation Complete**: 2025-10-25
- All 6 tasks completed successfully
- TypeScript compilation passes
- Biome checks pass (0 errors, 0 warnings)

- `packages/extension/media/preview.ts` (added CSS message handlers)
- `packages/extension/src/extension/preview/PreviewPanel.ts` (integrated CSS injection)

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Live Reload CSS on File Change (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: When a developer edits and saves a CSS file, the preview automatically reloads that CSS without restarting the Eligius engine or losing timeline state.

**Independent Test**: Modify an imported CSS file while the preview is open, save it, and verify that changes appear immediately without timeline restart.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T015 [P] [US2] Create `CSSWatcherManager` class in `packages/extension/src/extension/css-watcher.ts` - Initialize watcher state (disposables, tracked files, debounce timers)

- [x] T018 [US2] Implement `updateTrackedFiles()` method in `css-watcher.ts` - Update tracked files set without recreating watcher
- [x] T019 [P] [US2] Implement `dispose()` method in `css-watcher.ts` - Clean up watcher, clear debounce timers, prevent memory leaks
- [x] T020 [P] [US2] Implement `reloadCSS()` method in `webview-css-injector.ts` - Hot-reload single CSS file (load content, rewrite URLs, send `css-reload` message) (completed in Phase 3)
- [x] T021 [US2] Add `css-reload` message handler to webview script - Update existing `<style>` tag content with new CSS (completed in Phase 3)
- [x] T022 [US2] Integrate watcher into preview manager - Create watcher manager, start watching CSS files, wire onChange callback to `reloadCSS()`
- [x] T023 [US2] Add watcher disposal to preview cleanup - Dispose watcher in `panel.onDidDispose()` callback

**Checkpoint**: CSS files hot-reload when changed, timeline continues playing without restart ‚úÖ

**Implementation Complete**: 2025-10-25
- All 9 tasks completed successfully
- CSS watcher uses single FileSystemWatcher with per-file debouncing (300ms)
- Hot-reload preserves Eligius engine state (timeline position, data, elements)
- Ready for manual testing

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/extension/src/extension/css-watcher.ts` (created, 195 lines)
- `packages/extension/src/extension/preview/PreviewPanel.ts` (integrated watcher)

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Handle CSS File Errors Gracefully (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: When a CSS file has errors or cannot be loaded, the preview displays clear error messages and continues functioning with previous valid CSS.

**Independent Test**: Introduce CSS syntax errors or remove CSS files, verify the preview shows helpful error messages and remains functional.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T024 [P] [US3] Implement `showCSSError()` method in `webview-css-injector.ts` - Display VS Code notification with file path and error message (completed in Phase 3)

- [x] T026 [US3] Update `loadCSSFile()` in `css-loader.ts` - Wrap file operations in try/catch, throw typed errors (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, ReadError) (completed in Phase 3)
- [x] T027 [US3] Update `injectCSS()` error handling in `webview-css-injector.ts` - Catch file read errors, send `css-error` message, show notification, continue with other files (completed in Phase 3)
- [x] T028 [US3] Update `reloadCSS()` error handling in `webview-css-injector.ts` - Catch errors, send `css-error` message, show notification, keep previous CSS (completed in Phase 3)
- [x] T029 [P] [US3] Add `css-error` message handler to webview script - Log error, display error indicator (optional), retain previous CSS (completed in Phase 3)
- [x] T030 [US3] Implement error notification rate limiting in `webview-css-injector.ts` - Max 3 notifications per minute per file (completed in Phase 3)

**Checkpoint**: CSS errors are handled gracefully, preview remains functional with previous valid styles ‚úÖ

**Implementation Complete**: 2025-10-25 (completed during Phase 3)
- All error handling tasks completed as part of core implementation
- Typed errors: FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, ReadError
- Rate limiting: Max 3 notifications per minute per file

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (Phase 3): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (Phase 4): Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 components but independently testable
  - User Story 3 (Phase 5): Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1/US2 but independently testable
- **Testing (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on testing validation

### Within Each User Story

- **User Story 1**:
  - T009 (injector class) and T011 (webview handler) can run in parallel [P]
  - T010, T012, T013, T014 are sequential (depend on T009/T011)

- **User Story 2**:
  - T015, T017, T019 (watcher components) and T020, T021 (reload logic) can run in parallel [P]
  - T022, T023 (integration) are sequential

- **User Story 3**:
  - T024, T025, T026, T029 can run in parallel [P]
  - T027, T028, T030 depend on earlier tasks

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T001-T003) marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks (T004-T008) marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All Testing tasks (T031-T044) marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch in parallel:
Task T009: "Create WebviewCSSInjector class"
Task T011: "Add webview message handler script"

# Then sequential:
Task T010: "Implement injectCSS() method" (depends on T009)
Task T012: "Integrate CSS injection into preview manager" (depends on T010)
Task T013: "Configure Content Security Policy" (depends on T012)
Task T014: "Update preview manager to pass CSS files" (depends on T012)
```

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# All foundational tasks can run in parallel (different functions, no dependencies):
Task T004: "Implement generateCSSId()"
Task T005: "Implement convertToWebviewUri()"
Task T006: "Implement rewriteCSSUrls()"
Task T007: "Implement loadCSSFile()"
Task T008: "Implement extractCSSFiles()"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T008) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T009-T014)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test that CSS loads in preview
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**Result**: Basic CSS loading works, developers can see styles in preview

---

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP**: Setup + Foundational + User Story 1 ‚Üí CSS loads in preview ‚úÖ
2. **Enhanced**: Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Hot-reload works ‚úÖ
3. **Polished**: Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Error handling works ‚úÖ
4. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

---

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup (Phase 1) + Foundational (Phase 2) together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T009-T014)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T015-T023)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T024-T030)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to user stories for traceability
- **Foundational phase**: CRITICAL - must complete before any user story
- **Each user story**: Independently completable and testable
- **Manual testing**: No unit tests required per constitution (manual integration tests in Phase 6)
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group
- **Checkpoints**: Stop after each phase to validate independently
- **Constitution compliance**: All code must pass Biome + TypeScript checks before completion (T047, T048)
