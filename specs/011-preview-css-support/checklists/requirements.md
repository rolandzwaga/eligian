- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and pass inspection:

1. **Content Quality**: The spec focuses entirely on user needs and business value. While some VS Code API terms appear in Dependencies and Assumptions sections (appropriate locations), the core spec remains technology-agnostic.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 12 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No clarification markers remain. Success criteria are measurable with specific time targets (500ms, 300ms) and quantifiable outcomes.

3. **Feature Readiness**: The spec defines 3 prioritized user stories with clear acceptance scenarios, comprehensive edge cases, and well-defined scope boundaries.

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No outstanding issues or concerns
- All acceptance scenarios are testable without implementation knowledge
