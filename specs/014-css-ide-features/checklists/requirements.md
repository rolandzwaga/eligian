# Specification Quality Checklist: CSS IDE Features

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification is written in plain language focusing on user needs
- No mention of specific technologies (PostCSS, TypeScript, etc.)
- All sections describe "what" developers need, not "how" to implement
- Language is accessible to product managers and stakeholders

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are clear and testable
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Each FR has clear pass/fail criteria
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentages, frequency)
- All success criteria focus on user outcomes, not system internals

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning phase
- 4 user stories with clear priorities (P1, P2, P2, P3)
- Each story is independently testable
- 14 functional requirements cover all aspects
- 8 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Dependencies on Feature 013 clearly stated
- Constraints and scope boundaries well-defined

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: Excellent
- Well-structured with prioritized user stories
- Clear distinction between must-have (P1), should-have (P2), and nice-to-have (P3) features
- Success criteria appropriately focus on developer productivity metrics
- Edge cases proactively identified
- Dependencies on Feature 013 properly documented

**Ready for Next Phase**: Yes - `/speckit.plan` can proceed
