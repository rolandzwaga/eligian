# Feature Specification: Test Coverage Improvement

**Feature Branch**: `004-test-coverage-improvement`
**Created**: 2025-01-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "test coverage improvement - fix failing tests and achieve 80% coverage threshold"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - All Existing Tests Pass (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on the Eligian DSL project, I need all existing unit tests to pass so that I can confidently develop new features without introducing regressions.

**Why this priority**: Failing tests indicate broken functionality or outdated test expectations. This must be fixed first before any coverage improvements, as coverage metrics are meaningless if tests are failing.

**Independent Test**: Run `npm run test` and verify all tests pass with 0 failures. This delivers immediate value by ensuring existing functionality works as documented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the test suite contains failing tests, **When** I run `npm run test`, **Then** all tests pass with 0 failures
2. **Given** tests are failing due to outdated expectations, **When** I examine the grammar and validation rules, **Then** I update test expectations to match current DSL syntax
3. **Given** tests are failing due to bugs, **When** I identify the root cause, **Then** I fix the implementation to match the test expectations

### User Story 2 - Business Logic Meets 80% Coverage Threshold (Priority: P2)

As a developer maintaining the Eligian compiler, I need business logic (compiler, validator, transformer) to have at least 80% test coverage so that I can catch bugs before they reach production.

**Why this priority**: Once tests pass, achieving coverage threshold ensures all critical code paths are tested. This prevents regressions and improves code quality.

**Independent Test**: Run `npm run test:coverage` and verify all business logic files meet or exceed 80% coverage for statements, branches, functions, and lines.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the test suite runs successfully, **When** I generate a coverage report, **Then** I can identify files below 80% threshold
2. **Given** a file has coverage below 80%, **When** I examine untested code paths, **Then** I write unit tests to cover those paths
3. **Given** all new tests are added, **When** I run coverage again, **Then** all business logic files meet 80% threshold

---

### User Story 3 - Coverage Report is Analyzable (Priority: P3)

As a developer reviewing test coverage, I need a detailed coverage report showing file-by-file metrics so that I can identify specific areas needing additional tests.

**Why this priority**: Detailed reports enable targeted test additions. This is lower priority because it's a means to achieving the threshold (US2), not the end goal.

**Independent Test**: Run `npm run test:coverage` and verify the report displays file-by-file coverage with statements, branches, functions, and lines percentages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** tests have been run with coverage enabled, **When** I view the coverage report, **Then** I see coverage percentages for each source file
2. **Given** a coverage report is displayed, **When** I identify files below threshold, **Then** I can drill down to see specific uncovered lines
3. **Given** coverage data is available, **When** I compare before/after metrics, **Then** I can verify coverage improvements

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a file has unreachable code paths (e.g., error handling for impossible states)?
- How does the system handle generated files that should be excluded from coverage (e.g., Langium-generated parsers)?
- What happens when tests pass locally but fail in CI due to environment differences?
- How does coverage tracking handle files with only type definitions (no executable code)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST run successfully with 0 failures when executing `npm run test`
- **FR-002**: Coverage report MUST be generated when executing `npm run test:coverage`
- **FR-003**: Coverage report MUST display statements, branches, functions, and lines percentages for each file
- **FR-004**: All business logic files (compiler, validator, transformer, type system) MUST achieve at least 80% coverage across all metrics
- **FR-005**: Tests MUST be updated to reflect current Eligian DSL syntax and grammar rules
- **FR-006**: New tests MUST be added to cover untested code paths in files below threshold
- **FR-007**: Generated files (e.g., `*.generated.ts`, Langium parser output) MUST be excluded from coverage requirements
- **FR-008**: Test files themselves (e.g., `*.spec.ts`) MUST be excluded from coverage calculations
- **FR-009**: Coverage thresholds MUST fail the build if not met (enforce quality gate)

### Key Entities

- **Test Suite**: Collection of unit tests validating compiler, validator, transformer, and type system behavior
- **Coverage Report**: Document showing file-by-file test coverage metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- **Business Logic Files**: Source files containing core DSL compilation logic (excludes tests, generated files, configuration)
- **Threshold**: Minimum acceptable coverage percentage (80%) for business logic files

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of existing tests pass when running `npm run test` (0 failures)
- **SC-002**: 100% of business logic files achieve at least 80% coverage for statements, branches, functions, and lines
- **SC-003**: Coverage report generation completes in under 30 seconds for the entire test suite
- **SC-004**: Developers can identify files needing additional tests within 10 seconds of viewing coverage report
- **SC-005**: Test suite execution time remains under 2 minutes after adding new tests for coverage

## Assumptions

- The project uses Vitest for testing (based on existing test infrastructure)
- Coverage thresholds are configured in Vitest configuration
- Business logic is primarily located in `packages/language/src/` and `packages/compiler/src/`
- Generated files are already excluded via `.gitignore` or explicit coverage configuration
- Test files use `*.spec.ts` naming convention and are located in `__tests__/` directories
- The 80% threshold applies to all four coverage metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- Some files may have legitimate reasons for lower coverage (document exceptions in code comments)

## Scope

### In Scope

- Fixing all failing unit tests
- Updating test expectations to match current DSL grammar and validation rules
- Adding new unit tests to achieve 80% coverage for business logic
- Generating and analyzing coverage reports
- Excluding generated files and test files from coverage calculations

### Out of Scope

- Writing integration tests (focus on unit tests only)
- Achieving 100% coverage (80% is the target threshold)
- Adding tests for VS Code extension UI components (if any)
- Performance optimization of test execution
- Setting up continuous integration (CI) coverage enforcement (this spec focuses on local development)
- Refactoring existing code to improve testability (only add tests, don't change implementation unless fixing bugs)

## Dependencies

- Vitest test framework must be properly configured
- Coverage reporting tool (e.g., c8 or Vitest's built-in coverage) must be installed
- Existing test infrastructure (test helpers, fixtures, mocks) must be functional
- Current Eligian DSL grammar documentation must be up-to-date for test validation

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Tests fail due to outdated grammar expectations | High - blocks coverage improvement | Carefully review grammar and validation rules before updating tests |
| Achieving 80% coverage requires extensive refactoring | High - scope creep | Only add tests; document files that legitimately cannot reach 80% and request exceptions per Constitution Principle II |
| Coverage report shows unreachable code paths | Medium - inflates uncovered percentage | Document unreachable paths with comments explaining why they exist |
| New tests significantly slow down test suite | Medium - impacts developer productivity | Use focused test cases; avoid redundant tests; ensure tests run efficiently |
| Generated files skew coverage metrics | Low - already excludable | Verify generated files are excluded via configuration |
