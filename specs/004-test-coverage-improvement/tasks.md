# Tasks: Test Coverage Improvement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-test-coverage-improvement/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Monorepo structure: `packages/language/src/`, `packages/compiler/src/`
- Tests in `__tests__/` subdirectories alongside source files
- All paths relative to repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify test infrastructure configuration

- [X] T001 [P] [Setup] Verify Vitest configuration in `packages/language/vitest.config.ts` includes coverage exclusions and 80% thresholds
- [X] T002 [P] [Setup] Verify `@vitest/coverage-v8` package is installed and configured
- [X] T003 [P] [Setup] Run pnpm run test baseline - **RESULT: ALL 349 TESTS PASSING! Phase 2 (US1) can be skipped**


**Checkpoint**: âœ… Infrastructure verified - All tests already passing! Proceeding directly to Phase 3 (Coverage Analysis)

---

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - All Existing Tests Pass (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **User Story 1 (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - MUST complete before US2 (cannot measure coverage with failing tests)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 3)**: Depends on US1 completion - test suite must pass before adding coverage tests
- **User Story 3 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US2 completion - verifies coverage report infrastructure
- **Polish (Phase 5)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Blocking - MUST complete first (failing tests block coverage measurement)
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 - can only achieve coverage threshold after tests pass
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US2 - verifies reports show achieved coverage

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (Fix Failing Tests)**:
- T004 (Analysis) â†’ T005 (Documentation) â†’ T006-T011 (Fixes in parallel) â†’ T012-T014 (Verification)

**User Story 2 (Achieve 80% Coverage)**:
- T015-T017 (Baseline) â†’ T018-T023 (Add tests in parallel by file) â†’ T024-T027 (Exceptions) â†’ T028-T033 (Verification)

**User Story 3 (Analyzable Reports)**:
- T034-T040 (Verification tasks, can run in parallel)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T001, T002 independent)

**Phase 2 (US1)**:
- T006, T007, T008 can run in parallel (different test files)
- T010, T011 can run in parallel (different concerns)

**Phase 3 (US2)**:
- T018, T019, T020 can run in parallel (different source files)
- T021, T022 can run in parallel (different type system files)
- T023 can run in parallel with above (helper utilities)

**Phase 4 (US3)**:
- T034-T040 can run concurrently (all verification, no dependencies)

**Phase 5 (Polish)**:
- T041, T042, T043 can run in parallel (different files)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all core compiler test additions together:
Task: "Add tests for uncovered paths in packages/language/src/eligian-validator.ts"
Task: "Add tests for uncovered paths in packages/language/src/eligian-scope.ts"
Task: "Add tests for uncovered paths in packages/compiler/src/ast-transformer.ts"

# While those run, launch type system test additions:
Task: "Add tests for uncovered paths in packages/language/src/type-system-typir/eligian-type-checking.ts"
Task: "Add tests for uncovered paths in packages/language/src/type-system-typir/eligian-types.ts"

# All of these can proceed in parallel because they target different files
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: User Story 1 (T004-T014)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run `npm run test` - should pass with 0 failures
4. This is the MVP: tests passing, ready for development

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup â†’ Infrastructure verified
2. Complete User Story 1 â†’ **Deploy/Demo**: All tests pass (MVP!)
3. Complete User Story 2 â†’ **Deploy/Demo**: 80% coverage achieved
4. Complete User Story 3 â†’ **Deploy/Demo**: Coverage reports verified
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup together (T001-T003)
2. Team completes US1 together (T004-T014) - sequential dependency on test failures
3. Once US1 done, US2 tasks can be parallelized:
   - Developer A: T018, T019 (validator, scope tests)
   - Developer B: T020 (transformer tests)
   - Developer C: T021, T022 (type system tests)
4. US3 verification can be single developer (T034-T040)

## Notes

- All tests follow Constitutional Principle II (Comprehensive Testing) requirements
- Target: 80% coverage (statements, branches, functions, lines) for business logic
- Generated files excluded: `*.generated.ts`, `**/generated/**`, `*.spec.ts`, `**/__tests__/**`
- Test suite execution must remain <2 minutes (SC-005)
- Coverage report generation must remain <30 seconds (SC-003)
- Document coverage exceptions with justification, request user approval per Constitution
- Each user story is independently testable via its "Independent Test" criteria
- User Story 1 is MVP - delivers value even if US2/US3 are deferred
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Commit after each logical group of tasks
- Run `npm run check && npm run typecheck` after completing each phase
