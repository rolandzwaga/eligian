# Specification Quality Checklist: Test Coverage Improvement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-23
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Quality Assessment

- **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on testing outcomes (tests passing, coverage thresholds) without prescribing implementation details
- **Requirements**: All 9 functional requirements are testable (can verify with `npm run test` and `npm run test:coverage`)
- **Success Criteria**: All 5 criteria are measurable (percentages, time limits) and technology-agnostic (no mention of Vitest internals)
- **User Scenarios**: 3 prioritized user stories (P1: fix failing tests, P2: achieve coverage, P3: analyze reports) with independent test strategies
- **Edge Cases**: 4 edge cases identified covering unreachable code, generated files, CI differences, and type-only files
- **Scope**: Clear boundaries - in scope (unit tests, 80% threshold) vs out of scope (integration tests, 100% coverage, CI setup)

## Notes

- Specification successfully addresses constitution Principle II (Comprehensive Testing) requirements
- Coverage threshold (80%) aligns with constitutional mandate
- Exception process documented for files that cannot reach threshold
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and actionable
