# Specification Quality Checklist: JSDoc-Style Documentation Comments

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items validated successfully. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Clear three-tier priority structure (P1: Parse, P2: Auto-gen, P3: Hover)
- Each user story is independently testable as specified
- Comprehensive edge cases identified
- 18 functional requirements with clear, testable criteria
- 10 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- No implementation details mentioned (language-agnostic)

**Areas of Excellence**:
- Success criteria include both performance metrics (SC-002: 500ms, SC-005: 300ms) and user satisfaction metrics (SC-009: 90% success rate)
- Edge cases anticipate real-world challenges (mismatched params, malformed comments, changing signatures)
- Key entities clearly defined with relationships

## Notes

- The specification leverages existing type inference functionality (mentioned in user input), which is a dependency but doesn't require clarification since it's already implemented
- JSDoc syntax is industry-standard, so no clarification needed on format details
- All potential ambiguities resolved through reasonable defaults based on JSDoc conventions
