# Specification Quality Checklist: CSS Class and Selector Validation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED (All items complete)

### Content Quality Review

**✅ No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT needs to be validated and WHY, without specifying HOW. Implementation notes in Assumptions section appropriately document technical choices without prescribing implementation.

**✅ User value focus**: All 4 user stories clearly articulate developer pain points (catching typos, validating selectors, hot-reload, error handling) and business value (preventing runtime errors, maintaining flow).

**✅ Non-technical language**: While the domain involves technical concepts (CSS, selectors), the spec explains them in plain language accessible to product managers and stakeholders.

**✅ Mandatory sections**: All required sections present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) with complete content.

### Requirement Completeness Review

**✅ No clarification markers**: Spec contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are concrete and actionable.

**✅ Testable requirements**: All 30 functional requirements use testable language (MUST parse, MUST validate, MUST complete within Xms). Example: FR-025 "System MUST complete CSS re-parsing and re-validation within 300ms" is directly measurable.

**✅ Measurable success criteria**: All 11 success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "within 50ms"
- SC-002: "within 300ms"
- SC-003: "100% of CSS selectors"
- SC-005: "up to 1000 class/ID definitions", "parsing < 100ms"

**✅ Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes (error feedback timing, validation accuracy, performance) rather than implementation details. Implementation choices (PostCSS, Levenshtein) are documented in Assumptions, not Success Criteria.

**✅ Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each of 4 user stories has 3-6 Given/When/Then scenarios covering happy path, error cases, and edge cases. Total: 15 acceptance scenarios.

**✅ Edge cases identified**: 8 edge cases documented covering: deleted files, duplicate classes, nested imports, CSS variables, relative paths, variable references, uninitialized state, rapid changes.

**✅ Clear scope boundaries**: FR-027 to FR-030 explicitly define what is IN scope (direct imports, classes/IDs) and OUT of scope (transitive imports, pseudo-classes, attributes). "Out of Scope" section defers IDE features to Spec 2.

**✅ Dependencies documented**: 5 dependencies listed (Features 010/011, Langium, PostCSS, postcss-selector-parser) with clear relationships.

**✅ Assumptions documented**: 10 assumptions cover technical choices, performance targets, and validation rules with rationale.

### Feature Readiness Review

**✅ Requirements have acceptance criteria**: Each functional requirement maps to at least one acceptance scenario in user stories. Example: FR-019 (Levenshtein suggestions) → US1 acceptance scenario 1 ("Did you mean: primary?").

**✅ User scenarios cover primary flows**:
- US1 (P1): Basic className validation - core flow
- US2 (P2): Complex selector validation - advanced flow
- US3 (P2): Hot-reload - continuous workflow
- US4 (P3): Error handling - defensive flow

**✅ Measurable outcomes met**: Success criteria directly support user story goals:
- US1 goal (catch typos) → SC-010, SC-011 (zero false positives/negatives)
- US3 goal (instant feedback) → SC-001, SC-002 (< 50ms, < 300ms)

**✅ No implementation leakage**: While Assumptions mention PostCSS and Levenshtein, these are documented as reasonable defaults, not requirements. The spec could be satisfied with any parser/suggestion algorithm meeting the performance and accuracy criteria.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- All quality criteria met without requiring revisions
- Strong separation between requirements (WHAT) and implementation hints (HOW, in Assumptions)
- User stories prioritized logically: P1 = core value, P2 = enhanced UX, P3 = defensive
- Excellent edge case coverage prevents ambiguity during implementation
