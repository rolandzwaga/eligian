# Specification Quality Checklist: Constant Folding Optimization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**All items pass!** The specification is complete and ready for planning.

### Highlights:

1. **Technology-agnostic**: Spec focuses on "what" (inline constants, eliminate init actions) without prescribing "how" (AST traversal, optimization passes)

2. **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-002: "MUST replace every reference" - can count `$globalData` occurrences)

3. **Measurable success criteria**: SC-001 (20% JSON size reduction), SC-002 (100% inline rate), SC-003 (10% compile time) are all quantifiable

4. **User-focused**: Written from developer perspective (the "user" of the compiler), explaining value ("reduces size", "eliminates overhead")

5. **Well-scoped**: Clear boundaries (primitives only, global scope only, no cross-file resolution)

6. **Independent stories**: P1 (inline constants) can ship alone, P2 (eliminate init) adds value, P3 (expressions) is bonus

### No Issues Found

- ✅ All mandatory sections complete
- ✅ No clarifications needed (feature is well-understood)
- ✅ Edge cases documented
- ✅ Assumptions and constraints explicit
- ✅ Out of scope clearly defined

**Status**: ✅ Ready for `/speckit.plan`
