# Specification Quality Validation Checklist

**Feature**: Custom Action Reference Provider
**Spec File**: `specs/007-custom-action-reference/spec.md`
**Date**: 2025-10-24

## Mandatory Sections

- [x] **User Scenarios & Testing** - Present with 5 user stories
- [x] **Requirements** - Present with 12 functional requirements
- [x] **Success Criteria** - Present with 7 measurable outcomes

## User Story Quality

### Story 1: Navigate to Action Definition from Direct Timeline Calls (P1)
- [x] Has clear priority level (P1)
- [x] Priority is justified ("most common use case")
- [x] Includes "Independent Test" description
- [x] Has 3 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- [x] Story is independently testable (MVP viable with just this story)

### Story 2: Navigate from Inline Endable Action Blocks (P1)
- [x] Has clear priority level (P1)
- [x] Priority is justified ("equally critical for developer productivity")
- [x] Includes "Independent Test" description
- [x] Has 3 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- [x] Story is independently testable

### Story 3: Navigate from Sequence Blocks (P2)
- [x] Has clear priority level (P2)
- [x] Priority is justified ("less common than direct calls")
- [x] Includes "Independent Test" description
- [x] Has 3 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- [x] Story is independently testable

### Story 4: Navigate from Stagger Blocks (P2)
- [x] Has clear priority level (P2)
- [x] Priority is justified ("less common than direct calls")
- [x] Includes "Independent Test" description
- [x] Has 3 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- [x] Story is independently testable

### Story 5: Find All References to Custom Actions (P3)
- [x] Has clear priority level (P3)
- [x] Priority is justified ("less frequently used than Go to Definition")
- [x] Includes "Independent Test" description
- [x] Has 3 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- [x] Story is independently testable

### Edge Cases
- [x] Contains at least 2 edge case scenarios (has 5)
- [x] Edge cases are specific and relevant to the feature
- [x] Each edge case describes expected behavior

## Requirements Quality

### Functional Requirements
- [x] All requirements use MUST/SHOULD language
- [x] All requirements are specific and testable
- [x] Requirements cover all user stories (FR-001 through FR-005 map to US1-US5)
- [x] Requirements are technology-agnostic where appropriate (describe WHAT, not HOW)
- [x] No vague or ambiguous requirements

### Key Entities
- [x] Key entities are defined (ActionDefinition, OperationCall, ReferenceInfo, Scope)
- [x] Entity definitions include attributes and relationships
- [x] Entity definitions are technology-agnostic (describe data, not implementation)

## Success Criteria Quality

- [x] All criteria are measurable (have specific metrics)
- [x] All criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on outcomes, not implementation)
- [x] Criteria cover performance (SC-001, SC-006)
- [x] Criteria cover correctness (SC-002, SC-003, SC-004)
- [x] Criteria cover usability (SC-005, SC-007)
- [x] No vague criteria (avoid "should work well", "fast enough", etc.)

## Clarification Markers

- [x] **Count of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: 0
- [x] **Within allowed limit** (max 3): Yes
- [x] All clarifications include multiple-choice options or specific questions: N/A (no clarifications needed)

## Additional Quality Checks

- [x] **Assumptions section** is present and clear
- [x] **Out of Scope section** is present and clear
- [x] **Open Questions section** is present (states "None at this time")
- [x] Specification is concise and readable
- [x] No contradictions between sections
- [x] All user stories have acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

**Summary**: The specification meets all mandatory requirements and quality standards:
- 5 user stories with clear priorities (P1, P2, P3) and independent test descriptions
- 12 functional requirements covering all timeline contexts and LSP integration
- 7 measurable success criteria covering performance, correctness, and usability
- 0 clarification markers (well within the 3-marker limit)
- Clear assumptions, out-of-scope items, and edge cases defined

**Recommendations**: None. The specification is ready for implementation planning.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate detailed implementation plan and design artifacts.
