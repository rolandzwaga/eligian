# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 4 - Validation Pipeline Unification

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Results (2025-01-28)

All checklist items passed on first validation:

**Content Quality**: ✅
- Spec focuses on WHAT (validation consistency) not HOW (implementation)
- User value clearly articulated (trust, time savings, workflow continuity)
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections present and complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all requirements are unambiguous)
- All 10 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-003 "produce identical validation errors" can be verified via parity tests)
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., SC-001 "100% of test fixtures", SC-004 "completes in under 10 seconds")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of Langium, TypeScript, or specific APIs)
- All 4 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios (Given/When/Then format)
- Edge cases comprehensively identified (5 scenarios covering CSS changes, parse errors, URIs, file sizes, shared imports)
- Scope is explicitly bounded (Out of Scope section clearly defines what's excluded)
- Dependencies and assumptions fully documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅
- All functional requirements mapped to user stories via acceptance scenarios
- User scenarios cover all primary flows (CSS validation, state isolation, parity testing, cleanup)
- Feature delivers measurable outcomes: 100% validation parity, zero inconsistencies, 80+ lines removed
- No implementation leakage (technical notes are segregated in Notes section for developer reference)

### Spec Quality Assessment

This specification achieves **excellent quality** across all dimensions:

1. **Clarity**: Root causes and user impact clearly explained
2. **Completeness**: All edge cases, risks, and dependencies identified
3. **Testability**: Every requirement has clear verification criteria
4. **Independence**: User stories can be implemented and tested independently
5. **Priority**: P1 (CSS validation) delivers immediate value, can be MVP

### Recommendation

✅ **PROCEED TO PLANNING** - Specification is production-ready, no clarifications or improvements needed.

This spec benefits from the comprehensive codebase analysis that identified specific root causes, making requirements highly actionable and testable.
