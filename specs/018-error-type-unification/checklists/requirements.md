# Specification Quality Checklist: Error Type Unification

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED
**Date**: 2025-01-28
**Iterations**: 1

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is ready for planning phase.

## Notes

The specification successfully consolidates requirements from the refactoring roadmap analysis. All implementation details have been abstracted to focus on user value and measurable outcomes. The spec is now ready for `/speckit.plan`.
