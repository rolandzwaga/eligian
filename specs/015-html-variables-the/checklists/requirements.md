# Specification Quality Checklist: HTML Variables

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items satisfied

**Validation Details**:

### Content Quality
- ✅ Specification uses domain language (HTML imports, variables, layout) without mentioning TypeScript, Langium, or specific APIs
- ✅ All user stories focus on developer experience and value (reusability, separation of concerns, error prevention)
- ✅ Non-technical stakeholders can understand requirements (uses familiar import syntax metaphors)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (security question resolved with Option A)
- ✅ All 13 functional requirements are testable (can verify import syntax, variable referencing, validation, etc.)
- ✅ Success criteria include concrete metrics (80% reduction, <10% compile time increase, 95% error detection)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of compiler internals, AST, or tooling)
- ✅ 12 acceptance scenarios defined across 3 user stories
- ✅ 6 edge cases identified (template syntax, external dependencies, hot-reload, circular deps, whitespace, encodings)
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded (compile-time only, local files only, immutable variables)
- ✅ Dependencies (existing import system, variable system) and assumptions (UTF-8 encoding, <1MB files) documented

### Feature Readiness
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios (FR-001→US1, FR-004→US2, FR-005/FR-013→US3)
- ✅ Three user stories cover primary flows: import variables (P1), layout distinction (P1), validation (P2)
- ✅ Seven success criteria provide measurable outcomes aligned with user stories
- ✅ No implementation leakage (no mention of parser, transformer, Effect-ts, or compilation pipeline)

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if additional questions arise) or `/speckit.plan` (to begin implementation planning).

## Notes

- All checklist items passed validation
- Specification successfully resolved 1 clarification question (security restrictions)
- Ready to proceed to planning phase
