# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified Custom Action and Operation Call Syntax

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Validation Status**: âœ… PASSED (2025-01-23)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Clarification Resolved**: User selected Option A for backward compatibility - existing DSL code will break with clear error messages when Eligius adds operations that collide with existing custom action names. This ensures safety and prevents silent behavior changes.

**Spec Quality**: All mandatory sections completed, requirements are testable, success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. Ready for planning phase.
