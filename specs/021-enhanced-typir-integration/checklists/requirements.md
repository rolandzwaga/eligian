# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Typir Integration for IDE Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS

- **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- **User value focus**: All user stories clearly state the problem being solved
- **Non-technical language**: Written for business stakeholders (mentions "DSL developer" as user, not internal implementation)
- **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and detailed

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS

- **No clarification markers**: All requirements are concrete and actionable
- **Testable requirements**: Each FR has clear validation criteria (e.g., FR-004: "only one layout, one styles, one provider per document")
- **Measurable success criteria**: All SC have specific metrics (e.g., SC-002: "within 100ms", SC-003: "95% of asset type mismatches")
- **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: SCs focus on user outcomes (e.g., "Developers see import type information" not "Typir returns ImportType object")
- **Acceptance scenarios defined**: 25 scenarios across 5 user stories with Given/When/Then format
- **Edge cases identified**: 8 edge cases documented
- **Scope bounded**: Clear Out of Scope section with explicitly excluded features
- **Dependencies documented**: External dependencies (Typir, Typir-Langium, Langium) and internal dependencies (current integration, operation registry, grammar) listed

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS

- **Functional requirements with acceptance criteria**: All 37 FRs are testable (can verify with automated tests)
- **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 5 user stories (P1-P3) cover all major use cases with independent testability
- **Measurable outcomes**: 26 success criteria covering all user stories plus overall performance/experience
- **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains abstraction layer (e.g., "System MUST validate" not "Typir validator MUST check")

## Notes

- **Excellent specification quality**: This spec is ready for planning phase
- **Research-backed**: Based on comprehensive Typir research document (TYPIR_INTEGRATION_RESEARCH.md)
- **Incremental approach**: Phased rollout strategy with clear success criteria and rollback plans
- **Strong validation strategy**: 35+ test cases for Phase 1, 30+ for Phase 2, 35+ for Phase 3
- **Performance targets**: Clear NFRs with specific thresholds (< 50ms validation overhead)
- **Risk mitigation**: Assumes Typir limitations (optional parameters) and plans around them

## Recommendation

✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** - Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation tasks
