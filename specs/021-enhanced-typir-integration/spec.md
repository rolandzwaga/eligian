# Feature Specification: Enhanced Typir Integration for IDE Support

**Feature Branch**: `021-enhanced-typir-integration`
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Enhanced Typir integration for import statements, constants, timeline events, and control flow validation with rich IDE support"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Import Statement Type Checking (Priority: P1)

As a DSL developer, I want immediate feedback when I make mistakes in import statements (duplicate imports, wrong file types, missing files) so I can fix issues before running the timeline.

**Why this priority**: Import errors are critical blockers that prevent timelines from running. Early detection saves debugging time and improves the development experience. This is the highest-value, lowest-complexity enhancement from the research.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by writing various import statements (default and named) and verifying that hover, validation errors, and type inference work correctly without requiring any other feature to be implemented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user writes `styles './main.css'`, **When** they hover over the import statement, **Then** they see "Import<css>" type information
2. **Given** a user writes two `layout` imports, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see an error "Duplicate 'layout' import"
3. **Given** a user writes `import video from './intro.mp4' as html`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see a warning about type mismatch
4. **Given** a user writes `import data from './file.json' as css`, **When** they hover over the import, **Then** they see "Import<css>" showing the explicit override
5. **Given** a user references an imported asset name, **When** they use code completion, **Then** they see the asset name with its type

---

### User Story 2 - Enhanced Constant Validation (Priority: P1)

As a DSL developer, I want to be warned when I declare constants with reserved keywords so I avoid subtle runtime errors.

**Why this priority**: This is a quick win (2-hour implementation) that prevents common mistakes. Reserved keyword collisions can cause confusing errors, and catching them early improves developer experience. Type inference from constant values is already implemented in Phase 3 US1 (existing Typir integration).

**Existing Work**: Variable type inference (`VariableDeclaration` → inferred type from value) is already implemented in `eligian-type-system.ts:205-211`. This story ONLY adds reserved keyword validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by declaring constants with reserved keywords and verifying validation errors appear correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user writes `const if = 5`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see an error "'if' is a reserved keyword"
2. **Given** a user writes `const timeline = "test"`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see an error "'timeline' is a reserved keyword"
3. **Given** a user writes `const name = "value"`, **When** they hover over the constant name, **Then** they see the inferred type "string" (✅ Already works - existing Typir integration)
4. **Given** a user writes `const count = 42`, **When** they hover over the constant name, **Then** they see the inferred type "number" (✅ Already works - existing Typir integration)
5. **Given** a user references a constant, **When** type checking runs, **Then** the constant's inferred type is used for validation (✅ Already works - existing Typir integration)

---

### User Story 3 - Timeline Event Validation (Priority: P2)

As a DSL developer, I want to see validation errors for timeline events with invalid time ranges, overlapping events, or incorrect durations so I can create correct timelines before testing them.

**Why this priority**: Timeline events are complex and error-prone. Validating time ranges, durations, and overlaps prevents runtime issues and improves the authoring experience. This is medium-complexity but high-value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating timelines with various event configurations (overlapping, invalid ranges, negative times) and verifying validation works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user writes `at -1s..5s fadeIn()`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see an error "Start time cannot be negative"
2. **Given** a user writes `at 5s..2s fadeIn()`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see an error "End time must be greater than start time"
3. **Given** a user writes two events `at 0s..5s action1()` and `at 3s..7s action2()`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see a warning "Events overlap: [0s→5s] and [3s→7s]"
4. **Given** a user writes `sequence [...] for -2s`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see an error "Sequence duration must be positive"
5. **Given** a user writes `stagger 0s items with action() for 1s`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see an error "Stagger delay must be positive"
6. **Given** a user hovers over a timed event, **When** the hover appears, **Then** they see "TimedEvent: 0s → 5s" with timing details

---

### User Story 4 - Control Flow Type Checking (Priority: P3)

As a DSL developer, I want validation errors when I use wrong types in if conditions or for loop collections so I catch type errors early.

**Why this priority**: This adds polish and catches common type errors, but control flow already works well without it. This is lower priority because it's less critical than the other enhancements.

**Existing Work**: Action function types (RegularActionDefinition, EndableActionDefinition) are already implemented in `eligian-type-system.ts:246-346` with full type checking. This story ONLY adds control flow validation (IfStatement, ForStatement).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by writing control flow statements with various condition/collection types and verifying type validation works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user writes `if ("string") { ... }`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see a warning "Condition should evaluate to boolean"
2. **Given** a user writes `for (item in "string") { ... }`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see an error "For loop collection must be an array"
3. **Given** a user writes `for (item in $operationdata.items) { ... }` where items is an array, **When** type checking runs, **Then** no error appears
4. **Given** a user writes `if ($operationdata.count > 5) { ... }`, **When** type checking runs, **Then** the comparison is validated
5. **Given** a user writes an empty if branch, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see a warning "Empty if branch"

---

### User Story 5 - Timeline Configuration Validation (Priority: P3)

As a DSL developer, I want validation errors when my timeline configuration is inconsistent (e.g., video provider without source) so I catch configuration mistakes early.

**Why this priority**: Timeline configuration errors are caught during runtime, but early validation improves the experience. This is lower priority because it's less common and current validation already handles most cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating timelines with various provider/source combinations and verifying validation works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user writes `timeline "test" in "#app" using video { ... }` without a source, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see an error "Video provider requires a source file"
2. **Given** a user writes `timeline "test" in "#app" using raf from "./video.mp4" { ... }`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see a warning "RAF provider does not use a source file"
3. **Given** a user writes `timeline "test" in ".invalid[selector" using video from "./vid.mp4" { ... }`, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see an error "Invalid CSS selector"
4. **Given** a user hovers over a timeline, **When** the hover appears, **Then** they see "Timeline<video>" with configuration details
5. **Given** a user writes a timeline with no events, **When** the document is validated, **Then** they see a warning "Timeline has no events"

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user imports the same file twice with different asset types (e.g., `import a from './file' as html` and `import b from './file' as css`)?
- How does the system handle circular type dependencies in custom Typir types?
- What happens when Typir validation runs on a document with unresolved cross-references (e.g., action not yet defined)?
- How does validation behave when a CSS file imported via `styles` statement doesn't exist?
- What happens when timeline events have identical start/end times (0s..0s)?
- How does Typir handle type inference when an expression contains errors?
- What happens when a constant is declared but never used?
- How does validation handle timeline events with extremely large time values (e.g., 999999s)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Import Statement Type System (US1)

- **FR-001**: System MUST infer asset types for import statements based on keywords (`layout`, `styles`, `provider`) and file extensions
- **FR-002**: System MUST create a custom Typir type `ImportType` with properties: assetType ('html' | 'css' | 'media'), path (string), isDefault (boolean)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display inferred import type on hover (e.g., "Import<css>") in the IDE
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that default imports are not duplicated (only one `layout`, one `styles`, one `provider` per document)
- **FR-005**: System MUST warn when explicit asset type (`as` clause) conflicts with file extension
- **FR-005a**: Warning message format: "Asset type '<explicit>' conflicts with inferred type '<inferred>' from file extension (path: '<path>')"
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that import paths are syntactically valid (relative paths only)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide validation errors at the import statement location (not at usage sites)

#### Reserved Keyword Validation for Constants (US2)

- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that constant names do not collide with reserved keywords (`if`, `else`, `for`, `in`, `break`, `continue`, `const`, `action`, `endable`, `timeline`, `at`, `sequence`, `stagger`)
- **FR-009**: ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** (Phase 3 US1): System infers constant types from their initial values (string, number, boolean, object, array) - see `eligian-type-system.ts:205-211`
- **FR-010**: ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** (Phase 3 US1): System displays inferred constant type on hover in the IDE (automatic via Typir-Langium binding)
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide validation error when a constant name is a reserved keyword (error message: "'<keyword>' is a reserved keyword")
- **FR-012**: ~~System MUST validate that constants are not assigned void/undefined values (if void type is modeled)~~ **REMOVED** - Void type not modeled in Eligian grammar (constants always have values)

- **FR-015**: System MUST validate that timed event end times are greater than start times
- **FR-016**: System MUST detect overlapping timed events within the same timeline and display warnings. Events overlap if their time ranges intersect (start1 < end2 AND start2 < end1). Adjacent events (end1 == start2) do NOT overlap and should NOT trigger warnings.
- **FR-017**: System MUST validate that sequence durations are positive (> 0s)
- **FR-018**: System MUST validate that stagger delays are positive (> 0s)
- **FR-019**: System MUST display event timing details on hover (e.g., "TimedEvent: 0s → 5s")

- **FR-029**: System MUST validate that container selectors are syntactically valid CSS selectors
- **FR-030**: System MUST display timeline configuration details on hover (e.g., "Timeline<video>")
- **FR-031**: System MUST warn when timelines have no events

#### General Requirements

**Rollback Plan**: If Phase 3 causes issues, revert to Phase 2 state (US1-3 only)

---

### Migration Strategy

**Incremental Approach** (NOT Big Bang):

1. **Keep Langium Validators**: Don't remove existing validators immediately
2. **Run in Parallel**: Both Typir and Langium validation active during transition
3. **Compare Results**: Automated tests verify both produce same errors
4. **Gradual Removal**: Remove Langium validators only after Typir proven stable (Phase 1 complete)
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing validation behavior for external tools

**Feature Flag Approach**:
- Optional: Add configuration flag `eligian.typir.enabled` to disable Typir validation if needed
- Default: Enabled after Phase 1 success
- Allows users to opt-out if issues arise

---

### User Communication

**Documentation Updates**:
- Update `LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` with new validation behaviors
- Update `type-system-typir/README.md` with new features
- Create migration guide for users upgrading from older versions

**Release Notes**:
