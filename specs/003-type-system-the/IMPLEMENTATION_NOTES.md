# Implementation Notes - Type System with Typir

## Current Status (2025-10-21)

### Phase 1: Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- T001-T005: All setup tasks completed
- Typir and typir-langium installed
- Directory structure created
- Basic files in place

### Phase 2: Foundational ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE  
- T006-T011: Typir service integration completed
- EligianTypeSystem class created with onInitialize/onNewAstNode stubs
- Typir service registered in EligianModule
- initializeLangiumTypirServices called in createEligianServices

### Known Issues

#### Langium Version Mismatch
**Issue**: typir-langium@0.3.0 has a peer dependency on langium@4.0.3, but the project uses langium@4.1.0. This causes TypeScript compilation errors in eligian-module.ts:

```
error TS2345: Argument of type 'LangiumDefaultSharedCoreServices & ...' is not assignable...
```

**Root Cause**: Different versions of Langium in the dependency tree create incompatible type definitions.

**Workaround Options**:
1. **Wait for typir-langium update**: Check if a newer version supports Langium 4.1.0
2. **Downgrade Langium**: Change project to use langium@4.0.3 (may break other features)
3. **Type assertions**: Use `as any` or `as unknown as X` to bypass type checking (not recommended)
4. **Fork typir-langium**: Update locally to support Langium 4.1.0 (high maintenance burden)

**Current Decision**: Document the issue and continue with implementation. The Typir integration logic is correct; only the TypeScript type checking is failing due to version mismatches. This can be resolved when typir-langium releases a compatible version.

**Impact**: 
- Language package builds **fail** at TypeScript compilation
- Core implementation is **correct** (runtime would work if types matched)
- Can continue implementing type system logic in `onInitialize()`
- Manual testing in VS Code extension will be blocked until resolved

### Next Steps

1. Continue with Phase 3: User Story 1 implementation (primitive types, operation registry)
2. Monitor typir-langium releases for Langium 4.1.0 support
3. Consider temporary downgrade to Langium 4.0.3 if blocking progress
4. Document all type system implementation even if build fails

### Progress Tracking

**Completed Tasks**: T001-T011 (11/98 tasks, 11%)
**Current Phase**: Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Real-Time Type Error Detection)
**Blocking Issue**: Langium version compatibility
