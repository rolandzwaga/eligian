# Specification Quality Checklist: Robust Type System with Typir Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is comprehensive and ready for planning (`/speckit.plan`) or clarification (`/speckit.clarify` if any user stories need refinement).

### Validation Results:

**Content Quality**: ✅ All items pass
- Specification focuses on user needs and type system behavior
- No implementation details about TypeScript, Langium, or code structure
- Written in terms of developer experience and IDE behavior
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ All items pass
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- All 10 success criteria are measurable and include specific metrics
- Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes (error timing, test pass rates, autocomplete quality)
- All 6 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases cover type inference conflicts, recursion, missing type info, and dynamic scenarios
- Scope clearly bounded with comprehensive "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies (6 items) and assumptions (8 items) fully documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ All items pass
- Each functional requirement has corresponding acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios prioritized (P1-P4) with clear independent test descriptions
- Success criteria directly measurable (timing: 500ms/50ms, accuracy: 95%/90%, compatibility: 298 tests)
- No implementation details leak - specification maintains technology-agnostic language

### Assessment:

The specification is **COMPLETE and READY** for the next phase. It provides:
- Clear prioritization for incremental delivery (P1: Real-time errors → P2: Completions & Inference → P3: Cross-ref validation & Gradual typing → P4: Complex scenarios)
- Concrete, measurable success criteria that can guide implementation
- Comprehensive edge case coverage to inform robust design
- Well-defined boundaries (Out of Scope) to prevent scope creep
- Backward compatibility requirements ensuring safe adoption

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create detailed implementation plan based on this specification.
