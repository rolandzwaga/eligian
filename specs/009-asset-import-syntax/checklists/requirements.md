# Specification Quality Checklist: Asset Import Syntax

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: Spec describes WHAT (import syntax, validation rules) without HOW (Langium grammar is mentioned only in Dependencies section, which is appropriate for context)

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate developer needs and benefits (portability, code reuse, consistency)

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written in plain language accessible to product managers and stakeholders

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: Specification is complete with no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

✅ **Testable requirements**: All 18 functional requirements are verifiable through parsing tests and validation checks

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 5 success criteria include specific metrics (time bounds, percentages, binary outcomes)

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No mention of specific tools or frameworks in success criteria, focused on user outcomes

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: All 5 user stories include Given/When/Then scenarios

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 8 specific edge cases documented with expected behaviors

✅ **Scope bounded**: Clear In Scope vs Out of Scope sections, with out-of-scope items deferred to future features

✅ **Dependencies identified**: Langium grammar system, existing Eligian infrastructure listed

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each user story has 2-5 acceptance scenarios that can be independently tested

✅ **Primary flows covered**: User stories cover all import types (default, named, type override, path validation)

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: Success criteria focus on developer experience metrics (error time, coverage, productivity)

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Spec avoids dictating specific AST structures or grammar rules (mentioned only as deliverables, not requirements)

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Clear prioritization (P1/P2/P3) with rationale
- Well-defined scope boundaries preventing scope creep
- Measurable, user-focused success criteria

**Ready for next phase**: ✅ Yes
