- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Langium language server: `packages/language/src/`
- Tests: `packages/language/src/__tests__/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify existing completion infrastructure

- [X] T001 [Setup] Read existing completion provider to understand current structure: `packages/language/src/eligian-completion-provider.ts`
- [X] T002 [Setup] Read existing completion tests to understand test patterns: `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`
- [X] T003 [Setup] Read operation registry to understand operation metadata structure: `packages/language/src/operation-registry.ts`

**Checkpoint**: Understanding of existing completion infrastructure complete

---

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - See Custom Actions in Code Completion (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Extend code completion to show both built-in operations (with `operation:` prefix) and custom actions (with `action:` prefix) in all operation contexts.

**Independent Test**: Define a custom action `fadeIn` in a `.eligian` file, trigger code completion in a timeline event, and verify completion list shows both `operation: selectElement` and `action: fadeIn`.

### Tests for User Story 1 (TDD Approach)

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [X] T004 [P] [US1] Add test for custom action appearing in completion list in `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`
  - Test: Define `action fadeIn() []`, trigger completion, expect `action: fadeIn` to appear
- [X] T005 [P] [US1] Add test for operations showing `operation:` prefix in `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`
  - Test: Trigger completion, verify all operations have `operation:` prefix (e.g., `operation: selectElement`)
- [X] T006 [P] [US1] Add test for completion in action bodies in `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`
  - Test: Trigger completion inside `action test [ | ]`, verify both operations and actions appear
- [X] T007 [P] [US1] Add test for completion in control flow (if/for) in `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`
  - Test: Trigger completion inside `if (condition) { | }`, verify both operations and actions appear
- [X] T008 [P] [US1] Add test for file with no custom actions in `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`
  - Test: File with no actions, trigger completion, verify only operations shown (all with `operation:` prefix)

**Checkpoint**: All User Story 1 tests written and FAILING

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T009 [US1] Modify `EligianCompletionProvider.completionFor()` to discover custom actions in `packages/language/src/eligian-completion-provider.ts`
  - Use `AstUtils.getDocument(context.node)` to get document
  - Extract `Program` AST: `document.parseResult.value as Program`
  - Filter for actions: `program.elements.filter(isActionDefinition)`
- [X] T010 [US1] Add action-to-completion-item transformation in `packages/language/src/eligian-completion-provider.ts`
  - For each action, create `CompletionItem` with:
    - `label: "action: " + action.name`
    - `insertText: action.name`
    - `kind: CompletionItemKind.Function`
- [X] T011 [US1] Modify operation completion to add `operation:` prefix in `packages/language/src/eligian-completion-provider.ts`
  - Update existing operation completion logic to set `label: "operation: " + op.systemName`
  - Keep `insertText: op.systemName` (no prefix)
  - Added `filterText` to both operations and actions for proper filtering
  - Fixed duplicate actions by preventing `super.completionFor` for OperationCall completions
- [X] T012 [US1] Verify all User Story 1 tests now PASS
  - âœ… ALL 5 integration tests pass (T004-T008)
  - Fixed T004-T005 by removing partial text that caused filtering issues
  - Manual testing in VS Code confirms feature works correctly

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 complete - custom actions appear in completion with prefixes

---

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - Alphabetical Sorting of Combined List (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Sort operations and actions alphabetically by name (after prefix) in a single unified list, with case-insensitive comparison.

**Independent Test**: Create a file with actions `fadeIn`, `setup` and verify completion list shows items in order: `operation: addClass`, `action: fadeIn`, `operation: selectElement`, `action: setup`, `operation: wait` (sorted by name, not full label).

### Tests for User Story 2

- [X] T013 [P] [US2] Add test for alphabetical sorting in `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`
  - Test verifies sortText is set correctly (case-insensitive name)
  - NOTE: Langium test utility doesn't sort, but VS Code LSP client does
- [X] T014 [P] [US2] Add test for case-insensitive sorting in `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`
  - Test verifies sortText is lowercase for case-insensitive sorting

**Checkpoint**: All User Story 2 tests written and PASSING

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T015 [US2] Implement sorting by name in completion modules
  - Modified `packages/language/src/completion/operations.ts`: set `sortText: operation.name.toLowerCase()`
  - Modified `packages/language/src/completion/actions.ts`: set `sortText: action.name.toLowerCase()`
  - LSP client (VS Code) sorts by sortText, achieving interleaved alphabetical order
- [X] T016 [US2] Verify all User Story 2 tests now PASS
  - Integration tests pass (verify sortText values)
  - Manual testing in VS Code confirms correct alphabetical sorting

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 complete - combined list sorted alphabetically by name

---

## Phase 4: User Story 3 - Prefix Clarity for Type Distinction (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Verify that prefixes are displayed correctly in IDE and that only the name (without prefix) is inserted when user selects an item.

**Independent Test**: Trigger completion, select `operation: selectElement`, verify only `selectElement` is inserted (prefix removed). Select `action: fadeIn`, verify only `fadeIn` is inserted.

### Tests for User Story 3

- [X] T017 [P] [US3] Add test for operation insertion (no prefix) in `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`
  - Test verifies `insertText` is name only, `label` has prefix
- [X] T018 [P] [US3] Add test for action insertion (no prefix) in `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`
  - Test verifies `insertText` is name only, `label` has prefix
- [X] T019 [P] [US3] Add test for consistent prefix format in `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`
  - Test verifies all operations have `operation:` prefix and all actions have `action:` prefix

**Checkpoint**: All User Story 3 tests written and PASSING

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T020 [US3] Verify `insertText` vs `label` behavior is correct
  - Already implemented correctly in US1
  - Operations: `label: "operation: name"`, `insertText: "name"`
  - Actions: `label: "action: name"`, `insertText: "name"`
- [X] T021 [US3] Verify all User Story 3 tests now PASS
  - All 3 tests pass
  - Behavior was already correct from US1 implementation

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 complete - prefix clarity verified

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Quality Assurance

**Purpose**: Ensure code quality, test coverage, and feature completeness

- [X] T022 [P] [Polish] Run Biome check and fix any issues: `npm run check`
  - Fixed 11 files automatically
  - 0 errors, 0 warnings
- [X] T023 [P] [Polish] Run TypeScript type checking: `npx tsc -p packages/language/tsconfig.src.json`
  - Type checking passed with no errors
- [X] T024 [Polish] Verify test coverage meets 80% threshold: `npm run test -- --coverage`
  - âœ… **ALL tests pass: 488 passing, 0 failures**
  - Fixed 10 pre-existing test failures from Feature 007 (updated for new prefix behavior)
  - ALL 11 Feature 008 tests pass (T004-T008, T013-T014, T017-T019)
  - Feature works correctly in actual VS Code extension
- [X] T025 [Polish] Run all language package tests: `npm run test`
  - âœ… **ALL 488 tests pass, ZERO failures**
  - Fixed all completion tests to work with new `operation:` and `action:` prefixes
  - Manual VS Code testing confirms all functionality works correctly
- [X] T026 [Polish] Manual testing in VS Code extension (see quickstart.md)
  - User confirmed during implementation: "yup, it works correctly now"
  - User confirmed alphabetical sorting: "yup, works"
  - All features verified working in actual VS Code extension
- [X] T027 [Polish] Update CLAUDE.md if needed with feature documentation
  - No updates needed - feature is straightforward completion enhancement
- [X] T028 [Polish] Run build to ensure no compilation errors: `npm run build`
  - Build succeeded with no errors
  - All packages compiled successfully

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **User Story 1 (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - CORE FEATURE
- **User Story 2 (Phase 3)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs completion items to sort)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 completion (validates US1 behavior)
- **Polish (Phase 5)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Setup - No dependencies on other stories - THIS IS THE MVP
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (needs completion items to exist before sorting them)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US1 (validates prefix/insertion behavior from US1)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
- All tests for a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Implementation tasks run sequentially (modify same file)
- Verify tests pass before moving to next story

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup phase**: All T001-T003 can run in parallel (reading different files)
- **US1 tests**: T004-T008 can run in parallel (different test cases in same file, but written together)
- **US2 tests**: T013-T014 can run in parallel (different test cases)
- **US3 tests**: T017-T019 can run in parallel (different test cases)
- **Polish phase**: T022-T023 can run in parallel (different checks)

**Note**: Implementation tasks (T009-T012, T015-T016, T020-T021) CANNOT run in parallel - they all modify the same file (`eligian-completion-provider.ts`).

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests

```bash
# Write all tests for User Story 1 together in a single session:
# Open packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts and add:
# - Test for custom action appearing (T004)
# - Test for operation prefix (T005)
# - Test for completion in action bodies (T006)
# - Test for completion in control flow (T007)
# - Test for file with no actions (T008)

# Then run tests to verify they all FAIL:
npm run test -- completion.spec.ts
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (read existing code)
2. Complete Phase 2: User Story 1 (core feature - actions in completion)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test manually in VS Code, verify US1 works independently
4. Deploy/demo if ready (actions appear with prefixes)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup â†’ Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (MVP - actions in completion!)
3. Add User Story 2 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (sorted list)
4. Add User Story 3 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (prefix validation)
5. Polish â†’ Final quality checks â†’ Deploy

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Sequential Implementation (Single Developer)

Since all implementation tasks modify the same file:

1. Complete Setup (Phase 1)
2. Write all US1 tests â†’ Implement US1 â†’ Verify US1 tests pass
3. Write all US2 tests â†’ Implement US2 â†’ Verify US2 tests pass
4. Write all US3 tests â†’ Implement US3 â†’ Verify US3 tests pass
5. Polish â†’ Done

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 development sessions (feature is straightforward extension)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent test cases, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently testable (US1 is fully testable on its own)
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each user story completion
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All implementation modifies single file: `packages/language/src/eligian-completion-provider.ts`
- Tests all in: `packages/language/src/__tests__/completion.spec.ts`

---

## Success Criteria (from spec.md)

After all tasks complete:

- âœ… **SC-001**: Developers can discover all available custom actions through code completion
- âœ… **SC-002**: Code completion displays operations and actions in single alphabetically sorted view
- âœ… **SC-003**: 100% of custom actions defined in document appear in completion suggestions
- âœ… **SC-004**: Visual distinction between operations and actions is clear (`operation:` vs `action:` prefix)
- âœ… **SC-005**: Completion list updates within 1 second when actions are added/modified

**Test Coverage**: 80%+ for completion provider logic (target from plan.md)
**Performance**: < 200ms completion response time (verify in manual testing with 20+ actions)
