# Specification Quality Checklist: Custom Action Code Completions

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✅
- Specification is written in user-focused language
- No mention of specific technologies (TypeScript, Langium, VS Code APIs)
- Focus is on what developers experience, not how it's implemented
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✅
- All 8 functional requirements are clear and testable:
  - FR-001: Testable by checking completion list contents
  - FR-002/003: Testable by verifying prefix format
  - FR-004: Testable by checking sort order
  - FR-005: Testable by selecting items and verifying insertion
  - FR-006: Testable in each context type
  - FR-007: Testable by modifying document and checking updates
  - FR-008: Testable by typing partial text and checking filtering
- Success criteria are measurable (SC-003: "100%", SC-005: "within 1 second")
- Success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., "Developers can discover" not "API returns")
- All 3 user stories have acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases cover important boundaries (name conflicts, large lists, filtering, contexts)
- Scope is bounded with "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies listed in Assumptions section

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✅
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories
- User stories are independently testable (P1, P2, P3 can be tested separately)
- Success criteria align with user stories:
  - SC-001 → US1 (discoverability)
  - SC-002 → US2 (alphabetical sorting)
  - SC-004 → US3 (visual distinction)
- No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`
- All checklist items pass on first validation
- Feature scope is clear and well-bounded
- User stories follow independent testability principle (MVP = P1 alone)
