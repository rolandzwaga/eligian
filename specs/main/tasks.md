- [ ] T093 [Compiler] Snapshot testing for JSON outputs in packages/compiler/src/__tests__/pipeline.spec.ts - BLOCKED: Schema alignment needed

**Checkpoint**: Compiler pipeline implemented but requires Eligius schema alignment. Core compiler stages (Transform, TypeCheck, Optimize, Emit) all working with 63 tests passing. Pipeline orchestration complete but tests blocked on schema mismatch between simplified DSL output and full IEngineConfiguration requirements.

**‚ö†Ô∏è SCHEMA ALIGNMENT REQUIRED**: The compiler currently emits a simplified configuration structure (`{ timeline, events, metadata }`), but Eligius expects the full `IEngineConfiguration` interface with properties like `id, engine, timelines (plural), eventActions, containerSelector, language, layoutTemplate, availableLanguages, initActions, actions, labels`. Before continuing with integration tests, CLI, or extension work, the following schema alignment tasks must be completed:

- [X] SA001 [Schema] Update EligiusIR types in packages/compiler/src/types/eligius-ir.ts to match full IEngineConfiguration structure
- [X] SA002 [Schema] Update ast-transformer.ts to map DSL concepts to full Eligius schema (timeline ‚Üí timelines array, events ‚Üí TimelineActions)
- [X] SA003 [Schema] Add default values for required Eligius fields (id, engine, containerSelector, language, layoutTemplate, etc.)
- [X] SA004 [Schema] Update emitter.ts to output complete IEngineConfiguration structure
- [~] SA005 [Schema] Update all compiler code and tests to work with full Eligius schema

  - [X] SA005b: Fixed type-checker.ts implementation to work with new IR (timelines, TimelineActions, operations)
  - [X] SA005c: Fixed optimizer.ts implementation to work with new IR structure (dead code elimination for timeline actions)
  - [X] SA005d: Fixed pipeline.ts to properly compose updated stages (fixed Program import)
  - [~] SA005e-h: Update remaining test files to work with new IR
    - [ ] type-checker.spec.ts: Update helper functions and test cases
    - [ ] optimizer.spec.ts: Update tests for timeline action optimization
    - [ ] emitter.spec.ts: Update tests for new emission functions
    - [ ] pipeline.spec.ts: Update end-to-end tests for full IEngineConfiguration output

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 Setup**: All T001-T010 can run in parallel (different package.json files)
- **Phase 2 Foundational**: T011-T014 (types) can run in parallel, T015-T017 (services) can run in parallel
- **Phase 3 Grammar**: T029-T030 (fixtures) can run in parallel with grammar definition
- **Phase 4 Validation**: T037-T041 (different validators) can run in parallel
- **Phase 5 Compiler**:
  - Within Transform: T050-T054 can run in parallel
  - Within TypeCheck: T060-T062 can run in parallel
  - Within Optimize: T065-T066 can run in parallel
  - Within Emit: T070-T072 can run in parallel
- **Phase 6 Error Reporting**: T094-T097 can run in parallel
- **Phase 8 Extension**: T139-T142 (completion providers) can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Phases (Minimum Viable Product)

**MVP Goal**: Working CLI compiler that can compile simple DSL files to JSON

1. **Phase 1: Setup** ‚Üí Dependencies installed, build works
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** ‚Üí Types and Effect services ready
3. **Phase 3: Grammar** ‚Üí Can parse simple DSL (timeline + events + actions)
4. **Phase 4: Validation** ‚Üí Basic validation (unique IDs, valid times)
5. **Phase 5: Compiler** ‚Üí AST ‚Üí JSON pipeline works
6. **Phase 6: Error Reporting** ‚Üí Clear error messages
7. **Phase 7: CLI** ‚Üí Command-line compiler works

**MVP Checkpoint**: Can compile `examples/simple-timeline.eli` from command line and get valid Eligius JSON

### Post-MVP (Extension)

8. **Phase 8: Extension** ‚Üí VS Code integration (syntax highlighting, validation, compilation)

**Full Product Checkpoint**: Can edit .eli files in VS Code with full IDE support

### Polish

9. **Phase 9: Polish** ‚Üí Documentation, examples, performance tuning

### Incremental Delivery

- After Phase 7 CLI: Deliverable CLI compiler, users can compile from command line
- After Phase 8 Extension: Deliverable VS Code extension, users can edit DSL in IDE
- After Phase 9 Polish: Production-ready release with docs and examples

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Phase] label maps task to specific feature phase
- Tests use vitest with `__tests__/` subdirectories and `.spec.ts` naming
- Test fixtures in `__fixtures__/` subdirectories
- Commit after each logical task group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate phase independently
- Follow constitution: simplicity, testing, functional programming, immutability
