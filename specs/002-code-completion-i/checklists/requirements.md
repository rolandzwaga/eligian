# Specification Quality Checklist: Code Completion for Eligian DSL

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Details

**Content Quality**: All sections are technology-agnostic and focus on user needs. The spec describes WHAT users need (operation completion, descriptions, alphabetical sorting) and WHY (reduce documentation lookups, prevent typos, improve productivity) without specifying HOW to implement it.

**Requirement Completeness**:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all user questions were answered: Q1=D, Q2=B, Q3=C)
- All 25 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-006 "show custom actions alongside operations" can be verified)
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., SC-002 "appear within 100ms", SC-007 "80% success rate")
- Success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., SC-001 focuses on "developers can discover" not "cache hit rate")
- 6 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios (30+ Given/When/Then scenarios)
- 7 edge cases identified with expected behavior
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds the feature
- 5 dependencies and 10 assumptions documented

**Feature Readiness**: The specification provides complete guidance for planning and implementation. Each user story is independently testable and delivers standalone value (P1: operations & actions, P2: keywords & events, P3: variables & parameters).

## Notes

No issues found. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan and technical design.
