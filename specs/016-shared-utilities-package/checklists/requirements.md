# Specification Quality Checklist: Shared Utilities Package

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Items Pass

The specification is complete and ready for planning (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
1. **Clear problem statement**: Feature 015 bug provides concrete motivation
2. **Prioritized user stories**: P1 (path resolution) → P2 (error messages) → P3 (cross-platform)
3. **Comprehensive requirements**: 19 functional requirements across 4 categories
4. **Measurable success criteria**: 10 specific, testable outcomes
5. **Well-defined scope**: Clear in-scope/out-of-scope boundaries
6. **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are unambiguous

**No issues found** - proceeding to next phase.

## Notes

- Specification references REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md for full context
- This is Phase 1 of 3-phase refactoring effort
- Feature 017 (CSS Consolidation) and Feature 018 (Error Unification) depend on this
